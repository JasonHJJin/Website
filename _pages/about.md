<div class="about-page-aboutme">
  <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
  <p>Originally from South Korea, I moved to the US in 8th grade and had the privilege of attending <a href="https://www.rectoryschool.org/">The Rectory School</a> in Connecticut, followed by <a href="https://www.andover.edu/">Phillips Academy Andover</a> in Massachusetts. With a passion for engineering, I embarked on a dual degree journey, obtaining a B.A. in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.fandm.edu/">Franklin & Marshall College</a>, fully supported by the Clarkson Family Grant's generous scholarship. Currently, I am completing a B.S. in Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University in the City of New York</a>.</p>
  <p>Now embracing NYC as my home, I am enthusiastically pursuing a variety of remote and local opportunities!</p>
