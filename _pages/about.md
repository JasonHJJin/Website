<div class="about-page-aboutme">
  <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>
  
  <p>As a master's student at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, pursuing a degree in Applied Analytics, I am interested in AI, Data Science, & Product Development. I'm also working on a project called <a href="https://www.surgg.io">Surgg</a> - a real-time search trend entertainment app recently featured in <a href="https://nyweekly.com/tech/surgg-real-time-video-coverage-of-trending-google-searches-bringing-you-breaking-news-before-it-hits-the-headlines/">New York Weekly</a></p>

  <p>I am authorized to work in the United States without sponsorship and would be interested in opportunities where I can develop as a TPM/data engineer.</p>
