Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jason Jin, and I am a recent Bachelor of Science graduate in Computer Engineering from Columbia University, with a background in Mathematics from Franklin & Marshall College. I am currently seeking new graduate opportunities in Machine Learning, Data Science, or Full Stack development. You can reach me at hj2602@columbia.edu, or connect with me on LinkedIn and GitHub. Please note that I do not require sponsorship.

During my academic journey, I have developed a strong skillset in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/Bootstrap. I am proficient in Data Science and Visualization tools like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. My experience spans across various tools, operating systems, and platforms, including AWS, MySQL, Git, Mac OS, Windows, Linux, MongoDB, Neo4j, Django, GCP, Docker, Jupyter, DataGrip, Apache Hadoop, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Synthesis & Simulation, FPGA, and Microsoft Office Suite.

Throughout my professional experiences, I have interned at HumusOn, Witchcompany Co., and Upcoming, where I honed my software engineering, machine learning, and front-end development skills. I also served as a Signals Intelligence Officer and English Interpreter for the Defense Security Agency in South Korea, where I received a Letter of Appreciation from the National Security Agency (NSA) and held the position of Squad Leader.

In my personal projects, I have been implementing machine learning algorithms for financial data analysis and decision-making through coursework at Columbia University. I am also a proud graduate of "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" with Dr. Angela Yu, where I expanded my web development skills, including Web3 DApp development, ICP live blockchain deployment, custom crypto token creation, and building NFT marketplaces. My Udemy certificate can be found here.

I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to new challenges and continue learning in the fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Full Stack development. If you are interested in connecting, please feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub.

Background
======
Originally from South Korea, I moved to the US in 8th grade and later attended Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts. I pursued a dual degree engineering program, earning a B.A. in Mathematics from Franklin & Marshall College, and I am currently completing my B.S. in Computer Engineering at Columbia University, with an expected graduation in May 2023.
